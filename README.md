## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**


PROJECT: **F23-FOUNDRY-DAO **
Here are our main objectives:
1. Establish a contract completely controlled by our DAO.
2. Every transaction the DAO wants to send will need to be voted on.
3. For voting, we'll utilize ERC 20 tokens.
4. 15% of the total supply is sent back to the community for upkeep.
